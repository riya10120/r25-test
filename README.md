#### Some Instructions
1. You may use any online resources, datasheets, or documentation needed, but be mindful of your time and stay focused on the task.
2. The duration of the test is 90 mins from 5:15pm to 6:45 pm.
3. There will be a MCQ test conducted [here](https://r25.munmap.net)
4. There are 3 tasks in the tests. Complete all of them.
5. In case you are not able to complete all the tasks, do upload the whatever you are able to do.
6. In the `README.md` of your repository include your thought process, places where you got stuck, where you used the help of chatGPT, google or other online resources.
7. Even if you are not able to solve anything. Do fill the readme and what your thought process would have been.
8. Carefully read the instructions to implement the required functionality.
9. Install [mingw(c compiler)](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/#w64devkit) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you haven't already done it.
10. After finishing your test, provide the link to your forked repository in the google form provided at the end.
     
### Aim/Objective: You are implementing code to control motors for a rover using data received from an RC transmitter.
## Description
You are implementing code to control a sabrtooth motor driver(we are only trying to control motor 1 using S1 of Sabertooth), connected to drive motors of the rover, using data received from an [RC transmitter](datasheets/transmitter-manual.pdf)(make note that the transmitter is configured to transmit data in extended limits). The data from the transmitter is being recieved by a SBUS reciever module, you can find about the data protocol used [here](https://github.com/bolderflight/sbus/blob/main/README.md). 

### Task 0: Fork the provided repository and ensure it is set to PUBLIC so we can access and assess your work.
### Task 1: Interpolation for Sabertooth.
The motor driver (`Sabertooth 2x60`) in the simplified serial mode (check out the [datasheets](datasheets/sabertooth(2x60).pdf))
Your task is to interpolate a channel value into the format accepted by the motor driver, and make the rover move in forward or backward direction.
### Task 2: Compile and run the code.

#### Code
1. [src/main.c](src/main.c): Code for running the test.
2. [lib/parsing.c](lib/parsing.c): Complete the defined `interpolation` function here.

#### How to Compile & Check your code
(make sure you are in the root directory)   
1. Compile your code by running: `make build`
2. To check if your code is implemented correctly run: `make check`
   
If you are able to compile your code successfully you should see something like this on your screen:

</p>

4. If your make check was unsuccesfull, you can clean your attempt by running `make clean`, review your implementation and repeat the previous steps.

# Solution
## Understanding

The task is to take a channel value from a motor driver (Sabertooth 2x60) in serial mode and convert it into a format that the motor driver accepts, so that the rover can be controlled to move forward or backward.
 

## Thought Process
To address the problem, I decided to implement an interpolation function that converts the channel value into a PWM signal compatible with the Sabertooth 2x60 motor driver's requirements. This involves mapping the input channel values to the motor driver's expected range for forward or backward motion based on the datasheet specifications.
## Implementation
so first i find out the algorithm for interpolation function using ai and then i implemented it on the cloned repository .i made all the changes according to .i got stuck at the compilation part as i dont have the make tool supporting file so i went back home i installed the necessary packages after that compiled it it was showing error[2] .i tried to figure out what was the error ,i rechecked everything ,i used ai but still couldnt get that.so execpt that compilation part i tried my best to solve this problem .

Mention the details, such as the scaling used in the interpolation and how you tested it.
